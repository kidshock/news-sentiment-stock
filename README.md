# News Sentiment Analysis and Stock Impact
This is a project for my Fundamental of Data Science Course at USTH. Special thanks to my teammate @luuly2110 for contributing to this project. 

Our group ranked: 1 out of 15 teams, with the highest score (19/20) :D

Since our project analysed 3 stocks, and all of them are processed in the same way, the code uploaded is only for NVDA

The process is as followed: get news --> get stock --> news process --> finbert sentiment --> analyse --> EDA --> LSTM --> LSTM_Fin --> Predict
